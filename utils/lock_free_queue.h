        We want a way for different processes to communicate with each other and in such a way that multiple threads can read data concurrently.
        An application is that we can have several worker threads complete several tasks and send the results to the queue
        On the other end, a receiver can compile all the results by reading from the queue

        This queue is a subset of this functionality in that it enforces the invariant of:
        Single Producer Single Consumer (SPSC) â€“ that is, only one thread writes to the queue and only one thread consumes from the queue.

        Importantly, this queue does not use locks or mutexes, meaning that there will be less context switches, reducing latency
